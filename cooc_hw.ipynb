know\\nwhen the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not\\ntell us.\\n\\nhold your tongue will you? said danglars pretending to restrain\\ncaderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the\\narbor. try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without\\ninterruption. see look at fernand and follow his example he is\\nwellbehaved!\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nfernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the\\nbull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen\\nfrom his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong\\nupon his rival when mercds smiling and graceful lifted up her\\nlovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. at this\\nfernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped\\nagain heavily on his seat. danglars looked at the two men one after\\nthe other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with\\nlove.\\n\\ni shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and i am very\\nmuch afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. heres an\\nenvious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing\\nhis wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from\\nunder his nose and takes on like a big baby. yet this catalan has eyes\\nthat glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and\\ncalabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one\\nblow. unquestionably edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will\\nmarry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all\\nunlessa sinister smile passed over danglars lipsunless i take a\\nhand in the affair he added.\\n\\nhallo! continued caderousse halfrising and with his fist on the\\ntable hallo edmond! do you not see your friends or are you too\\nproud to speak to them?\\n\\nno my dear fellow! replied dants i am not proud but i am happy\\nand happiness blinds i think more than pride.\\n\\nah very well thats an explanation! said caderousse. how do you\\ndo madame dants?\\n\\nmercds courtesied gravely and saidthat is not my name and in my\\ncountry it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the\\nname of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. so call me\\nmercds if you please.\\n\\nwe must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dants he is\\nso easily mistaken.\\n\\nso then the wedding is to take place immediately m. dants said\\ndanglars bowing to the young couple.\\n\\nas soon as possible m. danglars today all preliminaries will be\\narranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the\\nwedding festival here at la rserve. my friends will be there i hope\\nthat is to say you are invited m. danglars and you caderousse.\\n\\nand fernand said caderousse with a chuckle fernand too is\\ninvited!\\n\\nmy wifes brother is my brother said edmond and we mercds and\\ni should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.\\n\\nfernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and\\nhe could not utter a word.\\n\\ntoday the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony! you are in\\na hurry captain!\\n\\ndanglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercds said\\njust now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong\\nto me that may bring me bad luck.\\n\\nyour pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry\\nand we have lots of time the pharaon cannot be under weigh again in\\nless than three months.\\n\\nwe are always in a hurry to be happy m. danglars for when we have\\nsuffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good\\nfortune. but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i\\nmust go to paris.\\n\\nah really?to paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been\\nthere dants?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nhave you business there?\\n\\nnot of my own the last commission of poor captain leclere you know\\nto what i allude danglarsit is sacred. besides i shall only take the\\ntime to go and return.\\n\\nyes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he\\nadded to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand\\nmarshal gave him. ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea! ah\\ndants my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the\\ngood ship pharaon then turning towards edmond who was walking\\naway a pleasant journey he cried.\\n\\nthank you said edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers\\ncontinued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very\\nelect of heaven.\\n\\n\\n\\n chapter . conspiracy\\n\\ndanglars followed edmond and mercds with his eyes until the two\\nlovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas\\nthen turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and\\ntrembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of\\na drinkingsong.\\n\\nwell my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage\\nwhich does not appear to make everybody happy.\\n\\nit drives me to despair said fernand.\\n\\ndo you then love mercds?\\n\\ni adore her!\\n\\nfor long?\\n\\nas long as i have known heralways.\\n\\nand you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy\\nyour condition i did not think that was the way of your people.\\n\\nwhat would you have me do? said fernand.\\n\\nhow do i know? is it my affair? i am not in love with mademoiselle\\nmercds but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall\\nfind.\\n\\ni have found already.\\n\\nwhat?\\n\\ni would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune\\nhappened to her betrothed she would kill herself.\\n\\npooh! women say those things but never do them.\\n\\nyou do not know mercds what she threatens she will do.\\n\\nidiot! muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what\\nmatter provided dants is not captain?\\n\\nbefore mercds should die replied fernand with the accents of\\nunshaken resolution i would die myself!\\n\\nthats what i call love! said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than\\never. thats love or i dont know what love is.\\n\\ncome said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and\\nhang me i should like to help you but\\n\\nyes said caderousse but how?\\n\\nmy dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish\\nthe bottle and you will be completely so. drink then and do not\\nmeddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and\\ncool judgment.\\n\\nidrunk! said caderousse well thats a good one! i could drink four\\nmore such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks. pre\\npamphile more wine!\\n\\nand caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.\\n\\nyou were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the\\nend of this interrupted remark.\\n\\nwhat was i saying? i forget. this drunken caderousse has made me lose\\nthe thread of my sentence.\\n\\ndrunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it\\nis because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will\\nextract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last\\nlines of a song very popular at the time\\n\\ntous les mchants sont buveurs deau\\n\\ncest bien prouv par le dluge.\\n\\n\\nyou said sir you would like to help me but\\n\\nyes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dants did\\nnot marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted\\nmethinks and yet dants need not die.\\n\\ndeath alone can separate them remarked fernand.\\n\\nyou talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse and here is\\ndanglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to\\nyou that you are wrong. prove it danglars. i have answered for you.\\nsay there is no need why dants should die it would indeed be a pity\\nhe should. dants is a good fellow i like dants. dants your\\nhealth.\\n\\nfernand rose impatiently. let him run on said danglars restraining\\nthe young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says.\\nabsence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were\\nbetween edmond and mercds they would be as effectually separated as\\nif he lay under a tombstone.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nyes but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what\\nsense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one\\ngets out and ones name is edmond dants one seeks revenge\\n\\nwhat matters that? muttered fernand.\\n\\nand why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they\\nput dants in prison? he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered.\\n\\nhold your tongue! said danglars.\\n\\ni wont hold my tongue! replied caderousse i say i want to know why\\nthey should put dants in prison i like dants dants your health!\\nand he swallowed another glass of wine.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\ndanglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his\\nintoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand\\nthere is no need to kill him.\\n\\ncertainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having\\ndants arrested. have you that means?\\n\\nit is to be found for the searching. but why should i meddle in the\\nmatter? it is no affair of mine.\\n\\ni know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm but this i\\nknow you have some motive of personal hatred against dants for he\\nwho himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.\\n\\ni! motives of hatred against dants? none on my word! i saw you were\\nunhappy and your unhappiness interested me thats all but since you\\nbelieve i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the\\naffair as best you may and danglars rose as if he meant to depart.\\n\\nno no said fernand restraining him stay! it is of very little\\nconsequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry\\nfeeling or not against dants. i hate him! i confess it openly. do you\\nfind the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man\\nfor mercds has declared she will kill herself if dants is killed.\\n\\ncaderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and\\nlooking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dants!\\nwho talks of killing dants? i wont have him killedi wont! hes my\\nfriend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i\\nshared mine with him. i wont have dants killedi wont!\\n\\nand who has said a word about killing him muddlehead? replied\\ndanglars. we were merely joking drink to his health he added\\nfilling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us.\\n\\nyes yes dants good health! said caderousse emptying his glass\\nheres to his health! his healthhurrah!\\n\\nbut the meansthe means? said fernand.\\n\\nhave you not hit upon any? asked danglars.\\n\\nno!you undertook to do so.\\n\\ntrue replied danglars the french have the superiority over the\\nspaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent.\\n\\ndo you invent then said fernand impatiently.\\n\\nwaiter said danglars pen ink and paper.\\n\\npen ink and paper muttered fernand.\\n\\nyes i am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without\\nmy tools i am fit for nothing.\\n\\npen ink and paper then called fernand loudly.\\n\\ntheres what you want on that table said the waiter.\\n\\nbring them here. the waiter did as he was desired.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper\\nthere is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at\\nthe corner of a wood to assassinate him! i have always had more dread\\nof a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or\\npistol.\\n\\nthe fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars. give\\nhim some more wine fernand. fernand filled caderousses glass who\\nlike the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and\\nseized the glass.\\n\\nthe catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh\\nassault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the\\ntable.\\n\\nwell! resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of\\ncaderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.\\n\\nwell then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if\\nafter a voyage such as dants has just made in which he touched at the\\nisland of elba someone were to denounce him to the kings procureur as\\na bonapartist agent\\n\\ni will denounce him! exclaimed the young man hastily.\\n\\nyes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront\\nyou with him you have denounced i will supply you with the means of\\nsupporting your accusation for i know the fact well. but dants cannot\\nremain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and\\nthe day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his\\nincarceration!\\n\\noh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a\\nquarrel with me.\\n\\nyes and mercds! mercds who will detest you if you have only the\\nmisfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond!\\n\\ntrue! said fernand.\\n\\nno no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would\\nbe much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink\\nand write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized\\nthe denunciation we propose. and danglars uniting practice with\\ntheory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his\\nusual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he\\nhanded to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone\\n\\nthe honorable the kings attorney is informed by a friend of the\\nthrone and religion that one edmond dants mate of the ship\\npharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at\\nnaples and portoferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for\\nthe usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist\\ncommittee in paris. proof of this crime will be found on arresting him\\nfor the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his\\ncabin on board the pharaon.\\n\\nvery good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common\\nsense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will\\nthus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter\\nas i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats\\nall settled. and danglars wrote the address as he spoke.\\n\\nyes and thats all settled! exclaimed caderousse who by a last\\neffort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and\\ninstinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation\\nmust entail. yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous\\nshame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.\\n\\nyes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i\\nsay and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost\\nshould be sorry if anything happened to dantsthe worthy dantslook\\nhere! and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw\\nit into a corner of the arbor.\\n\\nall right! said caderousse. dants is my friend and i wont have\\nhim illused.\\n\\nand who thinks of using him ill? certainly neither i nor fernand\\nsaid danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained\\nseated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper\\nflung into the corner.\\n\\nin this case replied caderousse lets have some more wine. i wish\\nto drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercds.\\n\\nyou have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you\\ncontinue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand\\non your legs.\\n\\ni? said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken\\nman i cant keep on my legs? why ill wager i can go up into the\\nbelfry of the accoules and without staggering too!\\n\\ndone! said danglars ill take your bet but tomorrowtoday it is\\ntime to return. give me your arm and let us go.\\n\\nvery well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at\\nall. come fernand wont you return to marseilles with us?\\n\\nno said fernand i shall return to the catalans.\\n\\nyoure wrong. come with us to marseillescome along.\\n\\ni will not.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? you will not? well just as you like my prince\\ntheres liberty for all the world. come along danglars and let the\\nyoung gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses.\\n\\ndanglars took advantage of caderousses temper at the moment to take\\nhim off towards marseilles by the porte saintvictor staggering as he\\nwent.\\n\\nwhen they had advanced about twenty yards danglars looked back and saw\\nfernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his\\npocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon.\\n\\nwell said caderousse why what a lie he told! he said he was going\\nto the catalans and he is going to the city. hallo fernand! you are\\ncoming my boy!\\n\\noh you dont see straight said danglars hes gone right by the\\nroad to the vieilles infirmeries.\\n\\nwell said caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the\\nrighthow treacherous wine is!\\n\\ncome come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and\\nit will effect its purpose unassisted.\\n\\n\\n\\n chapter . the marriage feast\\n\\nthe mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves\\ninto a network of rubytinted light.\\n\\nthe feast had been made ready on the second floor at la rserve with\\nwhose arbor the reader is already familiar. the apartment destined for\\nthe purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each\\nof which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the\\nname of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a\\nwooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. and although\\nthe entertainment was fixed for twelve oclock an hour previous to\\nthat time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests\\nconsisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other\\npersonal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed\\nthemselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to\\nthe occasion.\\n\\nvarious rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the\\npharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed\\nunanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding\\ncondescension could possibly be intended.\\n\\ndanglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by\\ncaderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had\\nrecently conversed with m. morrel who had himself assured him of his\\nintention to dine at la rserve.\\n\\nin fact a moment later m. morrel appeared and was saluted with an\\nenthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who\\nhailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man\\nwhose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first\\nin command of the ship and as dants was universally beloved on board\\nhis vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at\\nfinding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly\\ncoincided with their own.\\n\\nwith the entrance of m. morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched\\nin search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the\\narrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a\\nlively sensation and to beseech him to make haste.\\n\\ndanglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but\\nere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards\\nthem composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in\\nattendance on the bride by whose side walked dants father the whole\\nbrought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.\\n\\nneither mercds nor edmond observed the strange expression of his\\ncountenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the\\nsunshine and the presence of each other.\\n\\nhaving acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty\\nshake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their\\nplaces beside fernand and old dantsthe latter of whom attracted\\nuniversal notice.\\n\\nthe old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed\\nwith steel buttons beautifully cut and polished. his thin but wiry\\nlegs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings\\nevidently of english manufacture while from his threecornered hat\\ndepended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. thus he came\\nalong supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged\\ncountenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one\\nof the aged dandies of  parading the newly opened gardens of the\\nluxembourg and tuileries.\\n\\nbeside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good\\nthings provided for the wedding party had induced him to become\\nreconciled to the dants father and son although there still lingered\\nin his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the\\npreceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the\\ndim and misty outline of a dream.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nas danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of\\ndeep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair\\nwho seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten\\nthat such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted\\noccasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance\\nand a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated\\nand restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like\\none who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\\n\\ndants himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar\\nto the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a\\ncivil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and\\nhappiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be\\nimagined.\\n\\nlovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercds boasted the same\\nbright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips. she moved\\nwith the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian. one more\\npracticed in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes\\nbeneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed\\nlashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes\\nbut on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile\\nthat seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am\\nvery happy.\\n\\nas soon as the bridal party came in sight of la rserve m. morrel\\ndescended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and\\nsailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already\\ngiven that dants should be the successor to the late captain leclere.\\nedmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of\\nhis affianced bride within that of m. morrel who forthwith conducting\\nher up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the\\nfeast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose\\nheavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of\\nseveral minutes.\\n\\nfather said mercds stopping when she had reached the centre of\\nthe table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place\\nhim who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and\\ngentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the\\ndirest torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even\\nbeneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen\\nretreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\\n\\nduring this time dants at the opposite side of the table had been\\noccupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. m. morrel was\\nseated at his right hand danglars at his left while at a sign from\\nedmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most\\nagreeable.\\n\\nthen they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages\\nand lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and\\nbrilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel\\nwithin the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than\\nrivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north. all the\\ndelicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the\\nsandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea.\\n\\na pretty silence truly! said the old father of the bridegroom as he\\ncarried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the\\ntopaz and which had just been placed before mercds herself. now\\nwould anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who\\ndesire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?\\n\\nah sighed caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is\\nabout to be married.\\n\\nthe truth is replied dants that i am too happy for noisy mirth\\nif that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you\\nare right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us\\nalmost the same as sorrow.\\n\\ndanglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and\\nbetrayed each fresh impression.\\n\\nwhy what ails you? asked he of edmond. do you fear any approaching\\nevil? i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this\\ninstant.\\n\\nand that is the very thing that alarms me returned dants. man does\\nnot appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness\\nis like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where\\nfierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of\\nall shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. i\\nown that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of\\nwhich i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercds.\\n\\nnay nay! cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that\\nhonor yet. mercds is not yet your wife. just assume the tone and\\nmanner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is\\nnot yet come!\\n\\nthe bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start\\nat every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops\\nof perspiration that gathered on his brow.\\n\\nwell never mind that neighbor caderousse it is not worthwhile to\\ncontradict me for such a trifle as that. tis true that mercds is not\\nactually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour\\nand a half she will be.\\n\\na general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the\\nexception of the elder dants whose laugh displayed the still perfect\\nbeauty of his large white teeth. mercds looked pleased and gratified\\nwhile fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\\n\\nin an hour? inquired danglars turning pale. how is that my\\nfriend?\\n\\nwhy thus it is replied dants. thanks to the influence of m.\\nmorrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every\\ndifficulty has been removed. we have purchased permission to waive the\\nusual delay and at halfpast two oclock the mayor of marseilles will\\nbe waiting for us at the city hall. now as a quarterpast one has\\nalready struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying\\nthat in another hour and thirty minutes mercds will have become\\nmadame dants.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nfernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow\\nand he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his\\nfalling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not\\nrefrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the\\nnoisy felicitations of the company.\\n\\nupon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of\\naffair. arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three\\noclock! commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!\\n\\nbut asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the\\nother formalitiesthe contractthe settlement?\\n\\nthe contract answered dants laughingly it didnt take long to\\nfix that. mercds has no fortune i have none to settle on her. so\\nyou see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come\\nvery expensive. this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\\n\\nso that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to\\nbe the actual wedding dinner! said danglars.\\n\\nno no answered dants dont imagine i am going to put you off in\\nthat shabby manner. tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to\\ngo and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission\\nentrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent. i shall be back\\nhere by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage\\nfeast.\\n\\nthis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests\\nto such a degree that the elder dants who at the commencement of\\nthe repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it\\ndifficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments\\ntranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the\\nbride and bridegroom.\\n\\ndants perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded\\nby a look of grateful pleasure while mercds glanced at the clock and\\nmade an expressive gesture to edmond.\\n\\naround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at\\nsuch a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social\\nposition not to feel the trammels of etiquette. such as at the\\ncommencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves\\naccording to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out\\nmore agreeable companions. everybody talked at once without waiting\\nfor a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or\\nher own thoughts.\\n\\nfernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars. as\\nfor fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the\\ndamned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and\\nas though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such\\ndeafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther\\nend of the salon.\\n\\ncaderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most\\nanxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room.\\n\\nupon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment\\nof dants united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken\\nof had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dants good\\nfortuneupon my word dants is a downright good fellow and when i\\nsee him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. i\\ncannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him\\nthat trick you were planning yesterday.\\n\\noh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly\\ndid feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but\\nwhen i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as\\nto become one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further\\ncause for apprehension. caderousse looked full at fernandhe was\\nghastly pale.\\n\\ncertainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one\\nwhen the beauty of the bride is concerned. upon my soul that future\\ncaptain of mine is a lucky dog! gad! i only wish he would let me take\\nhis place.\\n\\nshall we not set forth? asked the sweet silvery voice of mercds\\ntwo oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter\\nof an hour.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nto be sure!to be sure! cried dants eagerly quitting the table\\nlet us go directly!\\n\\nhis words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers.\\n\\nat this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every\\nchange in fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back\\nwith an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the\\nopen windows. at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct\\nsound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with\\nthe clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and\\nbuzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the\\nbridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension\\nquelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most\\ndeathlike stillness prevailed.\\n\\nthe sounds drew nearer. three blows were struck upon the panel of the\\ndoor. the company looked at each other in consternation.\\n\\ni demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name\\nof the law! as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened\\nand a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself\\nfollowed by four soldiers and a corporal. uneasiness now yielded to the\\nmost extreme dread on the part of those present.\\n\\nmay i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit? said m.\\nmorrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is\\ndoubtless some mistake easily explained.\\n\\nif it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation\\nbeing made meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and\\nalthough i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must\\nnevertheless be fulfilled. who among the persons here assembled\\nanswers to the name of edmond dants?\\n\\nevery eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation\\nhe could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm\\nvoice\\n\\ni am he what is your pleasure with me?\\n\\nedmond dants replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of\\nthe law!\\n\\nme! repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i\\npray?\\n\\ni cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons\\nthat have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary\\nexamination.\\n\\nm. morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. he\\nsaw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly\\nwell knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate\\ndecked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold\\nmarble effigy. old dants however sprang forward. there are\\nsituations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to\\nunderstand. he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the\\nofficer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said\\nmy worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. your\\nson has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in\\nregistering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at\\nliberty directly he has given the information required whether\\ntouching the health of his crew or the value of his freight.\\n\\nwhat is the meaning of all this? inquired caderousse frowningly of\\ndanglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nhow can i tell you? replied he i am like yourself utterly\\nbewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out\\nwhat it is about. caderousse then looked around for fernand but he\\nhad disappeared.\\n\\nthe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with\\nstartling clearness. the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed\\nappeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication\\nof the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\\n\\nso so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this\\nthen i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?\\nall i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves\\nto bring double evil on those who have projected it.\\n\\nnonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing\\nwhatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the\\npaper to pieces.\\n\\nno you did not! answered caderousse you merely threw it byi saw\\nit lying in a corner.\\n\\nhold your tongue you fool!what should you know about it?why you\\nwere drunk!\\n\\nwhere is fernand? inquired caderousse.\\n\\nhow do i know? replied danglars gone as every prudent man ought to\\nbe to look after his own affairs most likely. never mind where he is\\nlet you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.\\n\\nduring this conversation dants after having exchanged a cheerful\\nshake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered\\nhimself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make\\nyourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to\\nclear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to\\ngo so far as the prison to effect that.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\noh to be sure! responded danglars who had now approached the group\\nnothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain.\\n\\ndants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and\\nfollowed by the soldiers. a carriage awaited him at the door he got\\nin followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove\\noff towards marseilles.\\n\\nadieu adieu dearest edmond! cried mercds stretching out her arms\\nto him from the balcony.\\n\\nthe prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken\\nheart and leaning from the coach he called out goodbye mercdswe\\nshall soon meet again! then the vehicle disappeared round one of the\\nturnings of fort saint nicholas.\\n\\nwait for me here all of you! cried m. morrel i will take the first\\nconveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you\\nword how all is going on.\\n\\nthats right! exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as\\nquickly as you can!\\n\\nthis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of\\nterrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. the old\\nfather and mercds remained for some time apart each absorbed in\\ngrief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their\\neyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others\\narms.\\n\\nmeanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass\\nof water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit\\ndown at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed\\nnext to the seat on which poor mercds had fallen half fainting when\\nreleased from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dants.\\ninstinctively fernand drew back his chair.\\n\\nhe is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered\\ncaderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars.\\n\\ni dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine\\nsuch a scheme. i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of\\nwhoever wrought it.\\n\\nyou dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said\\ncaderousse.\\n\\nsurely answered danglars one cannot be held responsible for every\\nchance arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nyou can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys\\nhead.\\n\\nmeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every\\ndifferent form.\\n\\nwhat think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him\\nof this event?\\n\\nwhy replied he i think it just possible dants may have been\\ndetected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as\\ncontraband.\\n\\nbut how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since\\nyou are the ships supercargo?\\n\\nwhy as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the\\nmerchandise with which the vessel was laden. i know she was loaded with\\ncotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastrets\\nwarehouse and at smyrna from pascals that is all i was obliged to\\nknow and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars.\\n\\nnow i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me\\nyesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for\\nme!\\n\\nthere you see exclaimed danglars. now the mischief is out depend\\nupon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our\\nabsence and discovered poor dants hidden treasures.\\n\\nmercds however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers\\narrest. her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst\\nout in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\\n\\ncome come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is\\nstill hope!\\n\\nhope! repeated danglars.\\n\\nhope! faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on\\nhis pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his\\ncountenance.\\n\\ngood news! good news! shouted forth one of the party stationed in the\\nbalcony on the lookout. here comes m. morrel back. no doubt now we\\nshall hear that our friend is released!\\n\\nmercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him\\nat the door. he was very pale.\\n\\nwhat news? exclaimed a general burst of voices.\\n\\nalas my friends replied m. morrel with a mournful shake of his\\nhead the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected.\\n\\noh indeedindeed sir he is innocent! sobbed forth mercds.\\n\\nthat i believe! answered m. morrel but still he is charged\\n\\nwith what? inquired the elder dants.\\n\\nwith being an agent of the bonapartist faction! many of our readers\\nmay be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in\\nthe period at which our story is dated.\\n\\na despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercds the old man sank\\ninto a chair.\\n\\nah danglars! whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick\\nyou spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old\\nman or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. i am\\ndetermined to tell them all about it.\\n\\nbe silent you simpleton! cried danglars grasping him by the arm\\nor i will not answer even for your own safety. who can tell whether\\ndants be innocent or guilty? the vessel did touch at elba where he\\nquitted it and passed a whole day in the island. now should any\\nletters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon\\nhim will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his\\naccomplices?\\n\\nwith the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived\\nthe solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully\\nwistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity.\\n\\nsuppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a\\nbewildered look on his companion.\\n\\nto be sure! answered danglars. let us wait by all means. if he be\\ninnocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no\\nuse involving ourselves in a conspiracy.\\n\\nlet us go then. i cannot stay here any longer.\\n\\nwith all my heart! replied danglars pleased to find the other so\\ntractable. let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for\\nthe present to take their course.\\n\\nafter their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and\\nprotector of mercds led the girl to her home while some friends of\\ndants conducted his father nearly lifeless to the alles de meilhan.\\n\\nthe rumor of edmonds arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in\\ncirculating throughout the city.\\n\\ncould you ever have credited such a thing my dear danglars? asked m.\\nmorrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh\\ntidings of dants from m. de villefort the assistant procureur he\\novertook his supercargo and caderousse. could you have believed such a\\nthing possible?\\n\\nwhy you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the\\ncircumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very\\nsuspicious circumstance.\\n\\nand did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\ncertainly not! returned danglars. then added in a low whisper you\\nunderstand that on account of your uncle m. policar morrel who\\nserved under the other government and who does not altogether\\nconceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of\\nregretting the abdication of napoleon. i should have feared to injure\\nboth edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a\\nsoul. i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is\\nbound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are\\nmany things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.\\n\\ntis well danglarstis well! replied m. morrel. you are a worthy\\nfellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of\\npoor edmond having become captain of the pharaon.\\n\\nis it possible you were so kind?\\n\\nyes indeed i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion\\nof you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your\\npost for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you.\\n\\nand what was his reply?\\n\\nthat he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair\\nwhich he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that\\nwhoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners\\nwould have his preference also.\\n\\nthe hypocrite! murmured danglars.\\n\\npoor dants! said caderousse. no one can deny his being a\\nnoblehearted young fellow.\\n\\nbut meanwhile continued m. morrel here is the pharaon without a\\ncaptain.\\n\\noh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next\\nthree months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dants\\nwill be set at liberty.\\n\\nno doubt but in the meantime?\\n\\ni am entirely at your service m. morrel answered danglars. you\\nknow that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced\\ncaptain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to\\naccept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further\\nchange will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dants and\\nmyself each to resume our respective posts.\\n\\nthanks danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties. i fully\\nauthorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look\\ncarefully to the unloading of her freight. private misfortunes must\\nnever be allowed to interfere with business.\\n\\nbe easy on that score m. morrel but do you think we shall be\\npermitted to see our poor edmond?\\n\\ni will let you know that directly i have seen m. de villefort whom i\\nshall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor. i am aware he is a\\nfurious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings\\nattorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of\\none.\\n\\nperhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and\\nthats rather against him.\\n\\nwell well returned m. morrel we shall see. but now hasten on\\nboard i will join you there ere long.\\n\\nso saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded\\nin the direction of the palais de justice.\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\nyou see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have\\ntaken. do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?\\n\\nnot the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere\\njoke should lead to such consequences.\\n\\nbut who perpetrated that joke let me ask? neither you nor myself but\\nfernand you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the\\nroomindeed i fancied i had destroyed it.\\n\\noh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not. i\\nonly wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed\\nand crumpled in a corner of the arbor.\\n\\nwell then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and\\neither copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not\\ntake the trouble of recopying it. and now i think of it by heavens he\\nmay have sent the letter itself! fortunately for me the handwriting\\nwas disguised.\\n\\nthen you were aware of dants being engaged in a conspiracy?\\n\\nnot i. as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing\\nmore. it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the\\ntruth.\\n\\nstill argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of\\nthe kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it. you\\nwill see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of\\nus.\\n\\nnonsense! if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person\\nand that you know is fernand. how can we be implicated in any way?\\nall we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly\\nquiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that\\nthe storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.\\n\\namen! responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to\\ndanglars and bending his steps towards the alles de meilhan moving\\nhis head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one\\nwhose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.\\n\\nso far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have\\nit. i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty\\nof being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded\\nto hold his tongue. my only fear is the chance of dants being\\nreleased. but there he is in the hands of justice and added he\\nwith a smile she will take her own. so saying he leaped into a\\nboat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m. morrel had\\nagreed to meet him.\\n\\n\\n\\n chapter . the deputy procureur du roi\\n\\nin one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand\\ncours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being\\ncelebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by\\ndants. in this case however although the occasion of the\\nentertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar.\\ninstead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to\\nthe humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the\\nvery flower of marseilles societymagistrates who had resigned their\\noffice during the usurpers reign officers who had deserted from the\\nimperial army and joined forces with cond and younger members of\\nfamilies brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of\\nexile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate\\nto the rank of a god.\\n\\nthe guests were still at table and the heated and energetic\\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive\\npassions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily\\nfor five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness\\nto the violence of party feeling.\\n\\nthe emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held\\nsovereign sway over onehalf of the world counting as his subjects

military\\npart of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while\\nthe women commented on the divorce of josephine. it was not over the\\ndownfall of the man but over the defeat of the
